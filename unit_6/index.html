		<h1>The Design Process</h1>
		<hi>in Four Steps</h1>
		<h2 id="subhead">An illustrated exploration</h2>
		<p>I migrated into graphic design from a journalism background more than 10 years ago. While storytelling has always come naturally to me, the process of visual storytelling was something I began learning about through trial and error. While I had taken a number of art classes over the years and my magazine work exposed me to considerations of type, layout, and photography, I was not at all familiar with the steps that could take me from an initial problem to a great solution.</p>
		
		<p>When I finally started to read and learn about the process designers (and creatives of many stripes) typically take to navigate through a project, I had that wonderful, warm feeling you get when you realize that your instincts were right. The time I wanted to take to really learn about more about the client and the product were crucial! Creating the space to let things bubble up was critical. And taking the time to sketch drafts--sometimes many drafts--pushed my design work to a whole new level.</p>

		<p>Finding this time was hard in a work environment with a small and overloaded design team, however, and many clients would beg me to “just make it to look better.” Happily for me--and anyone considering this process--the shift toward digital communication and the rising notion that these steps, redubbed ‘design thinking’, had applications beyond the work of creatives fostered a new appreciation for the importance of the process. While time doesn’t always allow a deep dive into each step, attempting to honor them on any level will lead you to more wholistic, innovative designs and much happier clients.</p>

			<h3>Discovery</h3>
			<p>A client or teammate has asked you to create a logo, build a website, design an ad campaign, or craft an event invitation. Now it’s time to ask some very important questions: Who is the audience? What is out in the marketplace already that is similar and does the job well? What is unique about your company, event, or campaign? What are your client’s most important goals? On the more practical side: What is your budget and timeline? Some of these answers will be a click away, and some will require a conversation (or several). All of the answers will be important to your final product.</p>

			<h3>Brainstorm</h3>
			<p>Like the name sounds, this step should be satisfyingly messy. As you have defined and researched your project, what is bubbling up for you visually? Is there a color palette already coming to mind or a texture? A song or a video? Is there website you recently fell in love with that could be used for inspiration? Is there a typeface, illustration or photograph you have been thinking naturally lends itself to the content?</p>

			<p>I like to think in terms of creating a mood board at this stage. For a rebranding or major campaign, this could mean adding visual inspiration snippets to Pinterest or a magnetic board above my desk for days or weeks. For a quick turnaround project my mood board could be a few notes I make in my notebook between meetings or before I go to bed.</p>

			<h3>Sketching</h3>
			<p>This could happen using a drawing tablet or in wireframing software, but I am huge fan at this stage of putting an actual pen to paper before the digital work begins. Working on paper offers a chance to get some of your visual concepts down without committing time to getting set up in your software and helps you resist the temptation to take off with an idea before doing some deeper thinking. In general, you will find that letting yourself iterate this way lets you push past your initial ideas, which are often everyone else’s initial ideas, and on to something more unique and innovative. In an illustration course I once took the instructor typically asked us to take 8 to 10 cracks at a concept before deciding on a direction. I was amazed at how many ideas I thought were interesting quickly got tossed as I moved further away from my first musings and had to dig deeper for a design.</p>

			<h3>Designing</h3>
			<p>Now that you have taken the time to do your research, collected some visual inspiration, and sketched out some great rough ideas (and discarded some not-so-great ideas) you should be well prepared to get to work. The iteration process does not have to be over though. If there were two or even more ideas that were striking you as strong when you were sketching consider taking a crack at all of them. Clients with larger projects often want more than one or two ideas for an initial review, and the final solution could end up combining the best elements of more than one design.</p>
