	<h1>The Design Process in Four Steps</h1>
	<h2>An illustrated exploration</h2>
	<img src="images/header.png">

	<p>I migrated into graphic design from a journalism background more than 10 years ago. While storytelling has always come naturally to me, the process of visual storytelling was something I began learning about through trial and error. While I had taken a number of art classes over the years and my magazine work exposed me to considerations of type, layout, and photography, I was not at all familiar with the steps that could take me from an initial problem to a great solution.</p><br>


	<p>When I finally started to read and learn about the process designers (and creatives of many stripes) typically take to navigate through a project, I had that wonderful, warm sensation you get when you realize that your instincts were right. The time I wanted to take to really learn about more about the client and the product were crucial! And creating the space to let things bubble up, and to create--and toss out--rough drafts, were also critical.</p><br>


	<p>Finding this time was hard in a work environment with a small and overloaded design team, however, and many clients would beg me to “just make it to look better.” Happily for me--and anyone considering this process--the shift toward digital communication and the rising notion that these steps, redubbed ‘design thinking’, had applications beyond the work of creatives fostered a new appreciation for the importance of the process. While time doesn’t always allow a deep dive into each step, attempting to honor them on any level will help you create a product that goes way beyond just “looking good.”</p><br>

	<p>While there are many different ways to name and break down these stages, I am sticking with these:</p><br>
	<ol>
	<li>research</li>
	<li>brainstorm</li>
	<li>sketch</li>
	<li>design</li>
</ol>
